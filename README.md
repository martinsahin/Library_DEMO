# Library Demo
This is a coding test to assess SQL skill sets and coding style.

/*

-------------------------------------READ ME-------------------------------------

Please open "SQL Coding Test - Lirbary System" pdf file for the assessment.

In this solution, only the instructions in the task was followed and necassary
objects and/or attributes were added.

It should be known that this is a demo and need more development.

For instance, future improvements could be as follows;
 
	- Create categories, publishers, etc. schemas for books for details. We can add more colums for more details. (ex. Volume)
	- Stored procedure can be created for returns
	- Schema could be created for notifications and fee for late returns
	- Schema could be created that allows members to reserve book.
	- Schema could be created for other library users/members to loan/share books

and many more...

Thank you.
